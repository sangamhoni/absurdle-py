# ABSURDLE
Wordle's Evil Twin
***

## ABOUT
An adversarial Wordle variant powered by a greedy algorithm that constantly changes the secret word to evade your guesses, actively fighting to prolong the game for as long as possible. Instead of guessing a predetermined answer, your goal is to mathematically corner the AI until it has absolutely nowhere left to hide.  

**uses greedy algorithm for state space maximization**
